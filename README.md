# dotfiles
I use the Ubuntu Image on [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com) for my development work, and these dotfiles work on that image. It comes with some default bash dotfiles already, so I haven't included them here. YMMV.

## installation
Clone then run setup.sh:

  git clone git@github.com:lessan/dotfiles.git

  dotfiles/setup.sh
