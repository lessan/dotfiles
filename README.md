# dotfiles
I use the Ubuntu image on [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com) for my development work,
and these dotfiles work on that image. The image comes with some default bash dotfiles already, 
so I haven't included them here. YMMV.

## installation
Clone then run setup.sh:

    git clone git@github.com:lessan/dotfiles.git

    dotfiles/setup.sh

The first time you run vim, Plug will be downloaded and plugins installed.
